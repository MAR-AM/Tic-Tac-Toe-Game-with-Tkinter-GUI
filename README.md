# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-with-Tkinter-GUI
This Python code implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).
It allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a tie. The game randomly selects which player starts first. The GUI elements include buttons for the game grid, a label to display the current player's turn, and a reset button to start a new game. The game logic handles checking for a winner or a tie after each move and highlights winning combinations in green.
